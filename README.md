## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or higher is recommended) and a package manager like `npm` or `yarn` installed on your system.

### Installation & Setup
